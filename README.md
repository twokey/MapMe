# MapMe
MapMe connects Udacity students from all over the world. It combines geolocation services and Network API to provide an opportunity for student to share with their classmates what they find interesting.

## Motivation for the project
I practicedÂ concurrency, threading and parallelism when was working on this project. In particular, I utilized Grand Central Dispatch or GCD framework. It allowed me to create and make network requests on a background thread while updating UI interface on a main thread.
Now I can easily read and write data from various RESTful networked APIs. And what is more important now I know how to read and understand documentation for any RESTful networked API on the Internet.
I utilize Facebook API for authentication of users. It allows users quickly create an account without having to set a password. Also a validated email address allows to reach that user later.

## Installation
Clone the project to your Mac than build and run it.
